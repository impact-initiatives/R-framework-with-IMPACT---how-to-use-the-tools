# Analysis - Introduction

The framework is built around 4 steps: cleaning, composition, analysis, outputs

-   *Cleaning*: any manipulation to go from the raw data to the clean data
-   *Composition*: any manipulation before the analysis e.g. adding indicators, adding information from loop or main, aok aggregation, etc.
-   *Analysis*: any manipulation regarding only the analysis
-   *Outputs*: any manipulation to format the outputs.

The following section will present some introduction about the analysis.

The third step of the framework is the analysis. The analysis step aims to create a long table with one result per line and an **analysis key**. That table is not made for a human to read it but to store some information. Analysis stops at the results table: long format, stat + analysis key

The analysis key format is currently :

- analysis type @/@ analysis variable %/% analysis variable value @/@ grouping variable %/% grouping variable value

- analysis type @/@ dependent variable %/% dependent variable value @/@ independent variable %/% independent variable value

If there are two or more grouping variables it would look like that

- analysis type @/@ analysis variable %/% analysis variable value @/@ grouping variable 1 %/% grouping variable value 1 -/-  grouping variable 2 %/% grouping variable value 2

Same would apply for analysis variable in case of a ratio.

The current analysis types are :

- mean
- median
- prop_select_one: proportion for select one
- prop_select_multiple: proportion for select multiple
- ratio

## create_analysis

Any **create_analysis_*** function will need a survey to be used, not a dataset. A survey object will be defined with the weights, strata and cluster information if they exists.

### create\_\*

![](../config/images/verb - create.png)

**create_**\* functions will create, transform something, e.g. creating a cleaning log with the checks to be filled, create analysis results table, create an output.

Outputs from **create_**\* functions outputs can be in different shape, format, etc. 

**create_**\* function is catch-all.
:::

```{r}
library(analysistools)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
my_data <- analysistools_MSNA_template_data
only_nas <- analysistools_MSNA_template_data %>%
  summarise(across(.cols = everything(), .fns = function(x) {
    sum(is.na(x)) == nrow(analysistools_MSNA_template_data)
  })) %>%
  do.call(c, .)

my_data_shorter <- analysistools_MSNA_template_data[, !only_nas] %>%
  select(!grep("other", names(analysistools_MSNA_template_data), value = T))
```

::: {.callout-note .column-margin}
At the moment, `create_analysis` breaks where a column only have missing values. They need to be removed beforehand.
:::

```{r}
#| output: false
my_design <- srvyr::as_survey_design(my_data_shorter, strata = "admin1")

my_analysis <- create_analysis(my_design, sm_separator = "/")
```

::: {.callout-note .column-margin}
`create_analysis` uses a survey design, not a dataset. Survey design object contains the information on the design of the survey, such as stratas, cluster, weights. It is built with **srvyr** package which is a wrapper around [**survey** package](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/).

:::

`create_analysis` returns a list with:

- Results table: a long table with summary statistics per line
- Dataset: the dataset used with the survey design
- List of analysis: all the analysis that were performed 

```{r}
my_analysis %>%
  names()
```

```{r}
my_analysis$results_table %>%
  head()
```

```{r}
my_analysis$loa %>%
  head()
```
